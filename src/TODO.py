Workflow

1. Multiple plots
2. All plots in one plot figure, with a slider/widget below to turn on/off
certain plots, so cross-comparison can be made?
3. This requires some sort of a scaling for y-axis value to be implemented
as a widget. Different y-axis? Or do we simply ignore it for now, since it is
relative values that matter? Individual values can appear via hover.

Implement 2 and 3 then. Then, figure out how to integrate into GS.

Plotting function using history.
Also, need history over turns too? For plotting.

Maybe. Maybe focus on the plotting first. Price model, probably later, make a
working prototype first.

Then, plot can be made to run on this data structure. Maybe.

Also, maybe add comments now? or nah?

More useful test messages, specifying which is which.

Linked zoom

Sort out widget layout first, before working on testing callbacks.
Can implement callbacks for now.

Integrate bokeh into UI once buttons corresponding to each function work.
