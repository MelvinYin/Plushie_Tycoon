2. All plots in one plot figure, with a slider/widget below to turn on/off
certain plots, so cross-comparison can be made?

Implement 2 and 3 then. Then, figure out how to integrate into GS.

Plotting function using history.
Also, need history over turns too? For plotting.

Maybe. Maybe focus on the plotting first. Price model, probably later, make a
working prototype first.

Also, maybe add comments now? or nah?

Integrate bokeh into UI once buttons corresponding to each function work.
